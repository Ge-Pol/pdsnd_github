### Description
This is a program based on **Python** that lets you explore data related to bike share systems in **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**.

* average travel time

4. **Bike user information**
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

* (at least) Python 3, NumPy, and pandas (you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to install this)
* a text editor, like Sublime or Visual Studio Code.
* a terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Git Bash on Windows)
